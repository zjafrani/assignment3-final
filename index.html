  <p> During my time in the GBDA propgram at the University of Waterloo, I've had many opportunities to express my creativity. One of my favourite classes during my time in GBDA so far was GBDA 201: Introduction to Digital Media. One of my favourite projects that we worked on during this class was the 1st project, our photography project. This Project gave me the opportunity to express my creativity through one of my favourite mediums, Photography and truly gave me free reign to do whatever when it came to taking these photos. Another project that I thoroughly enjoyed creating was the short, silent film that we made for our 2nd project. 
      <p>
     
      Watch it here:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m4UmkOGzDQU" target="_blank">SLC Marketplace: A Silent Film</a>.
      
      </p> Both of these projects were not only fun and entertaining to create but allowed for me to express my creativity through different mediums but also allowed me to learn and gain new and practical skills for future projects and potential careers.

  <h2 style="border:4px solid Black;" >Education/Experience</h2>
    <p>Currently, I am a 2nd year GBDA student at the University of Waterloo. Prior to coming to Waterloo, I was at Bayview Glen Independent School for roughly 11 years up until June 2023. During my time at Bayview Glen, I had several leadership opportunities that helped me to learn valuable skills and lessons. For example, some of my most valuable and memorable experiences include being a student leader on a camp trip, working at my school's library, and being apart of my shcool's yearbook team. These experiences aided massively in developing crucial skills such as teamwork, collaboration, leadership and organization.</p>
